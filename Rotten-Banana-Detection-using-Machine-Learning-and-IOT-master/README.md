1) initially we have installed camera and sensor inside the refrigerator 
2) camera will capture the image in every 2 minutes and the sensor send the image to the server
3) that image will be processed by machine algo and the status is written into the file
4) if that banana is rotten then server will send the alert indicating that banana is getting Rotten i.e consume as soon as possible  or else user can explicitly see the current status of the fruit.
